# Chingu Solo Project - Tier 1 - Favorite Fonts

## Overview

This app was created for the Chingu Voyage 17 pre-work.
I did the tier 1 even checked as tier 1 I because noticed my level is still low and needed to practise more basic.

## Features

_Structure_

- [×] Header with minor navigation _(Logo and Catalog/Featured/Articles/About link list)_
- [×] Nav with Major navigation / page-manipulation _(search, custom text, font-size, dark/light mode, grid/list mode, and reset)_
- [×] Main section to contain the font cards
- [×] Font cards which display the Font Name, the font creator, the sample text, and an add button
- [×] Footer section with your developer information

_Style_

- [×] Sample text in each card should be displayed in the corresponding font
- [×] Buttons/links should be evident _(make sure the cursor changes, etc.)_
- [×] Implement a way to handle overflow from sample text in font cards, as the font size is adjustable

_Functionality_

- [×] Text typed into the custom text (type something) box should immediately change the sample text displayed in each font card
- [×] The sample text should return to the default sample if the input box (type something) no longer has any input _(ex. input == "")_
- [×] Font size chooser should have at least four sizes and should immediately change the sample text font size in each font card
- [×] Implement the clickable 'reset' icon on the far right of the major navigation; it should make the page appear as if the user reloaded the page _(do not actually reload the page)_

_Other_

- [×] Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
- [×] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting

_Extras (Not Required)_

- [×] Include a back-to-top button that allows users to scroll to the top once the top of the page is out of view
- [×] Make your design fully responsive _(small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)_
- [×] Implement the light/dark mode toggle buttons
- [×] Implement the change display icon so you can flip between a grid and list layout for the font cards
